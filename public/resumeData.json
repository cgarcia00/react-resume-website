This was part of a larger initiative to better track cloud costs at Discover and ensure that the millions of dollars of cloud spend at the company were billed correctly and belonged to the correct teams. I worked with Public Cloud Identity Team at Discover. I contributed velocity towards accomplishing the team‚Äôs goals of creating, configuring, and maintaining AWS accounts for teams at Discover in an Agile environment."

I participated in a twenty week program at Stanford where I along with four other students worked alongside the NPE team at Meta to make a web app companion for their VR App Global History Archive where people would join live tours of famous sites on the Meta Quest hosted by professional tour guides. My team, Edventure, placed top 3 in the project fair at the end of the program. I was responsible for the fullstack development of the web app. I used Firebase, Google‚Äôs PaaS platform, to host the Edventure website that had Firebase RealtimeDB to support livestream, chat, and 3D model manipulation. I used Firebase Auth to provide Google signin and create profiles. The front-end was designed with React."
